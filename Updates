**Livestock Farm Project – Refactor & Feature Update (May 9)**

---

**✅ Cattle Class Refactoring**

* Moved common fields (`id`, `location`, `vaccinated`, `earTag`) and methods (`vaccinate()`, `applyEarTag()`, `getId()`, `getLocation()`, `hasEarTag()`, etc.) to the abstract `Cattle` superclass.
* Simplified `BeefCattle` and `DairyCattle` classes to only override `getType()` and `Accept(visitor)` methods.
* This ensures consistent behavior and avoids code duplication.

---

**✅ Visitor Pattern Enhancements**

* `VeterinaryVisitor`:

  * Visits every cattle and vaccinates them if they haven't already been vaccinated.
* `MinistryVisitor`:

  * Checks each cattle for a plastic ear tag.
  * If missing, logs:
    `⚠️ Cattle with ID <id> has no ear tag! Applying one...`
    then applies the tag.
  * If already tagged, logs:
    `✔️ Cattle with ID <id> already has an ear tag.`
  * Fully aligns with the requirement that the ministry *checks* each animal, rather than silently applying tags.

---

**✅ Observer Pattern (Push-style Notification)**

* Converted `LocationDatabase` into a subject that supports `addObserver()` and `notifyObservers()`.
* `Farmer` class implements `Observer` and gets notified when a cattle exits farm boundaries.
* Notification message includes both ID and location:
  `Notifying farmer: Cattle <id> is outside the farm at <location>!`
* Ensures reactive behavior and simulates real-time location tracking.

---

**✅ Farm Boundary Monitoring**

* Defined valid farm locations: `"North Field"`, `"South Field"`, `"Barn"`, `"Pasture"`.
* `LocationDatabase.storeLocation()` now checks if a reported location is outside of these.

  * If so, prints:
    `ALERT: <id> exited the farm! Notifying farmer...`
    then triggers observer update.
* Implements the requirement: *“If a cattle exits the farm boundaries, the farmer is notified.”*

---

**✅ Main Class Cleanup and Beautification**

* Grouped outputs by design pattern for better readability:

  * Factory Pattern
  * Visitor Pattern
  * Adapter Pattern
  * Observer Pattern
  * Abstract Factory Pattern
* Added section headers and spacing to clarify flow.
* Simulated key scenarios:

  * A cattle missing an ear tag
  * A cattle going outside the farm boundary

---

**✅ Additional Improvements**

* Removed unnecessary method overrides in subclasses.
* Clarified logic around what it means to be “tagged.”
* Ensured behavioral consistency across components.
